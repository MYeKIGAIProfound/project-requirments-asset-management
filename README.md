# Asset Management Software Requirements Document

## Project Overview:

### Project Name: Asset Management Software for EV Manufacturing

### Goal:
The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive web application that enables Electric Vehicle (EV) manufacturing companies to efficiently manage their assets, including EVs, chargers, battery swapping stations, etc.

## Functional Requirements:

### 1. Web Dashboard:
   - Design and implement a user-friendly web dashboard for EV manufacturing companies.
   - Display detailed information about each asset, including location, current status, and customizable parameters based on the company's requirements.

### 2. Real-time Data Display:
   - Integrate IoT devices to fetch dynamic data from assets in real-time.
   - Display dynamic data such as online/offline status, current traffic, voltage, and current on the dashboard.
   - Allow customization of displayed parameters based on the user's preferences.

### 3. Analytics:
   - Provide analytical details like user count, revenue, and any other relevant metrics.
   - Implement visual representations, charts, and graphs to facilitate easy understanding of data trends.

### 4. Asset Management System:
   - Offer a robust Asset Management System for manufacturing companies.
   - Allow companies to create and manage users with different permission levels.
   - Enable customization of user roles and permissions based on specific responsibilities (e.g., managing chargers in a specific state).

### 5. User Permissions:
   - Implement a role-based access control system.
   - Define different user roles (e.g., admin, manager, operator) with varying levels of access.
   - Ensure secure and restricted access to sensitive data.

## Non-Functional Requirements:

### 1. Performance:
   - Ensure the web application performs efficiently, even with a large volume of data.
   - Optimize data retrieval and processing for quick response times.

### 2. Security:
   - Implement robust security measures to protect user data and system integrity.
   - Use encryption for data transmission and storage.

### 3. Scalability:
   - Design the system to be scalable, accommodating potential growth in the number of assets and users.

### 4. Compatibility:
   - Ensure compatibility with major web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

### 5. Documentation:
   - Provide comprehensive user and administrator documentation for the software.

## Assumptions and Constraints:

- Dynamic data availability depends on the data provided by the consumer company.
- The software will be compatible with IoT devices specified by the consumer.
